"""Execute the notebooks and hold each to what it's meant to do.

Two guarantees, both on every push:

* Every `solution.ipynb` runs end to end without error. Its checks call the reference
  implementation, so a check that disagrees with its own answer fails here rather than in the
  room. This also covers the Day 0 smoke test and the worked template.

* Every `lab.ipynb` fails, and fails *at a check*. The participant notebook ships with the
  exercise bodies removed, so a check that still passes on it is testing nothing (CLAUDE.md).
  Running it and demanding a `CheckFailed` keeps the graders honest: it catches a check so
  loose it would green-light an empty or scaffold answer.

    uv run python tools/run_notebooks.py                 # everything
    uv run python tools/run_notebooks.py src/day1-models  # one subtree

The `pip install` cell is skipped: CI installs the working tree, and reinstalling from GitHub
would test `main` instead of the branch under review.

GPU labs won't run here. GitHub's runners have no GPU, so give those a CPU-scaled path (see
`fast.colab.ci_mode`) or exclude them and run them by hand on Colab before delivery. Say which
ones are excluded; a silently skipped lab is worse than a red build.
